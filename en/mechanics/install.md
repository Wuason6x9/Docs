# Install Mechanics

## Common Issues

**Q: How do I install this?**  
A: You have to proceed to install `Mechanics.jar` in the server plugins folder.

## How does it work?

Mechanics is a Core for several plugins, so technically it does not work alone, but it is dependent on other plugins like StorageMechanic.

| **Commands**                                   | **Usage**                                                                                   |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/mechanics reload`                            | Reload Mechanics plugin                                                                    |
| `/mechanics adapter get <id> amount`           | This is to get an item through the AdapterID system that contains all the compatibilities   |
| `/mechanics adapter give <player> <id> <amount>` | This is to get an item through the AdapterID system that contains all the compatibilities   |
| `/mechanics adapter getAdapterID`              | This command shows you the adapterId of the item you have in hand. If you don't have an item in hand, nothing will be shown. |
